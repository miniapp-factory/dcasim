+Code the following app
+```
+Idea: A Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) simulator and backtester.
+User Goal: Validate the strategy of buying small amounts regularly versus trying to time the market.
+Core Features (MVP):
+
+* Input: Coin, Investment Amount, Frequency (Daily/Weekly), Start Date.
+* Comparison: DCA vs. Lump Sum (buying all at once on day 1).
+* Output: Total invested, Current Value, ROI %, Average Entry Price.
+* Visual chart of Portfolio Value over time.
+
+Development Plan:
+
+1. Build a robust historical price database (daily close prices).
+2. Create the calculation logic: iterate through dates and simulate buys.
+3. Develop a clean, "calculator-style" UI.
+4. Add a "Share Result" feature (image generation) for social media.
+5. Add support for top 50 coins.
+```
