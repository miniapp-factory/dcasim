```
Idea: A Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) simulator and backtester.
User Goal: Validate the strategy of buying small amounts regularly versus trying to time the market.
Core Features (MVP):

* Input: Coin, Investment Amount, Frequency (Daily/Weekly), Start Date.
* Comparison: DCA vs. Lump Sum (buying all at once on day 1).
* Output: Total invested, Current Value, ROI %, Average Entry Price.
* Visual chart of Portfolio Value over time.

Development Plan:

1. Build a robust historical price database (daily close prices).
2. Create the calculation logic: iterate through dates and simulate buys.
3. Develop a clean, "calculator-style" UI.
4. Add a "Share Result" feature (image generation) for social media.
5. Add support for top 50 coins.
```

Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.

The changes you need to make are in the following files:

1. `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` – update the `title` and `description` exported values.  
2. `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` – create or modify this file to describe the new app logo.  

Please add these files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

A stylized logo for a DCA simulator app: a circular gradient background fading from deep blue at the edges to a lighter teal center, with a bold white dollar sign ($) overlaid on a stylized coin icon. The coin icon has subtle metallic shading and a small sparkles effect to suggest value. Below the icon, the app name “DCA Simulator” is written in a modern sans‑serif font, centered and in white. The overall composition is clean, professional, and conveys the idea of systematic investment over time.
